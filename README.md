# InfraOps-Repo

### Getting Started with GitOps
 ```GitOps``` Uses git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application configurations, with automated tools syncing live services to the desired state in git.

 *Key Ideas:*
- **Declarative**: Define the desired state of your infrastructure and applications in configuration files.
- **Version Control**: Store all configurations in a Git repository, enabling versioning and collaboration.
- **Automation**: Use tools to automatically apply changes from the Git repository to the live environment.
- **Observability**: Monitor the live state of your infrastructure and applications to ensure they match the desired state in Git.
- **Pull Requests**: Use pull requests to propose changes, enabling code review and collaboration.
- **Continuous Delivery**: Automate the deployment process to ensure that changes can be released quickly and reliably.
- **Rollback**: Easily revert to a previous state by rolling back to a previous commit in Git.
- **Environment Management**: Manage multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) using branches or directories in the Git repository.
- **Security**: Use Git's access control features to manage permissions and ensure that only authorized users can make changes.
- **Continuous Reconciliation**: Continuously monitor the live state of the infrastructure and applications, automatically reconciling any drift from the desired state in Git.
